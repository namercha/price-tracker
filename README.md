## Price tracking bot
This python program tracks the price of an item on Amazon.com and then sends an email when the price crosses a certain threshold. 
The bot will scrape the web page for the price of an item and if it is below a set target price, it will send an email alerting the user to purchase. I use the SMTP module to send the email. 
The product for this example is an [instant pot](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Pressure-Steamer-Sterilizer/dp/B08PQ2KWHS/ref=dp_fod_2?pd_rd_i=B08PPZWNCV&th=1).
